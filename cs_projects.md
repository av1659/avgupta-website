  Here are some of the research projects I've been working on.
</p>

## Deep MotifGAN for Personalized Medicine
- **Ongoing.** PIs: Prof. James Zou and Prof. Anshul Kundaje at Stanford University
- Implementing Generative Adversarial Networks to develop novel DNA sequences enriched with transcription factor binding sites. Long term, these generated DNA sequences can be used as personalized genetic treatments for different diseases, and for other synthetic biology applications.
- Currently extending this project in two main ways, one applied and one theoretical. On the applied side, our goal is to extend MotifGAN's function to more diverse and complex DNA regulatory elements. On the theoretical side, we are developing new techniques to train GANs systematically for faster convergence.

## Deep Learning to Uncover Sequence Regulatory Motifs in _C. elegans_
- **Ongoing.** PIs: Prof. Anshul Kundaje at Stanford University
- Designing and profiling deep-learning models in Keras and Theano to uncover novel _in vivo_sequence regulatory motifs in _C. elegans_
- Started as project for CS373 (Statistical and Machine Learning Methods for Genomics)
- [Technical Report](../cs373-anvita-gupta.pdf) on Initial Findings

## Data-Driven Smart Drug Discovery for Cancer, Tuberculosis, and Ebola 
- **June 2014 – Feb 2015.** PI: Professor Gil Alterovitz at Harvard Medical School
- Led development of data-driven drug discovery system that uses Artificial
Intelligence (specifically Support Vector Machines) to find promising drug candidates; hybrid receptor and ligand based approach. 
- Algorithm applied to find novel drug leads for diseases like Cancer, Tuberculosis, and Ebola.
- Several of these TB drugs have been experimentally validated and are now in preclinical trials in China.
- _Talks_: Presented to President Obama at [2015 White House Science Fair]() and at [2015 White House Ebola Innovator Conference]()
- _Awards_: [1st Place at International BioGENEius Challenge](); [Top 3 in Intel Science Talent Search Global Good](); [National Winner in Siemens Competition]()

## Tgen MindCrowd Project 
- **June 2014 – Feb 2015.** PI: Professor Matt Huentelman, Tgen Neurodegenerative Disorders Lab
- Predictive big-data analytics for Mindcrowd study, largest nationwide study of demographic and genetic factors relating to Alzheimer's risk.

## Design of High Performance Computing Clusters
- **Dec 2014- May 2015.** Amba Solutions, Inc.
- Senior Research Project. Designed affordable High Performance Computing Cluster for record storage and analytics, using Hadoop distributed computing file system. Also designed clusters out of ARM processors for personal storage and computing devices.

## Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma: An Analysis of Drug Therapy Options through Interaction Maps and Graph Theory
- **Dec 2012 – Sep 2013.** Mentor: Dr Agrawal (Wright State University)
- Graph-theory approach to rank target proteins in Pancreatic Cancer. My first foray into the field of bioinformatics.
