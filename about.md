**Hey there! I'm Anvita Gupta.**

I'm an undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at Stanford University, specifically the biocomputation track. My passion is **Health + Tech**--applying AI to develop novel ways to treat deadly diseases. 

Some of the projects I've worked on include [developing smart data-driven approaches to drug discovery](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/six-degrees-drug-discovery-white-house-science-fair-me-anvita-gupta), designing high-performance computing clusters and the databases that layer on top of them, and recently, adapting generative adversarial networks for personalized medicine. Find out more details on my [projects]("../projects/index.html") page.

I'm also the founder of [LITAS (Learning IT, Applications, and Software) for Girls](http://www.litas4girls.org/), an international nonprofit working with middle and high school girls to close the gender gap in CS + STEM.

For more on me and my work, check out my [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjYweEgFtyw).
